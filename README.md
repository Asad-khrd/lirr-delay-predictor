A real-time dashboard that uses a machine learning model to predict the likely causes of Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) delays based on live transit data.

## Key Features

* **Live Data Integration:** Connects directly to the official MTA GTFS-RT feed to fetch the real-time status of active LIRR trains.
* **ML-Powered Predictions:** Uses a trained Random Forest model to predict the top 3 most likely causes of a delay for any given train, based on its branch, time of day, and other engineered features.
* **In-Depth Historical Analysis:** The model was trained on over 248,000 historical delay records from 2010-2022, with extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to validate features.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit to provide a clean, user-friendly interface that updates with live predictions.
